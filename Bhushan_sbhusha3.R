# 1. Reading a file with fields separated by "|"
# To read a file where fields are separated by "|", you would use the read.delim() function in R, specifying the sep argument as "|".
data <- read.delim("your_file.txt", sep = "|")
library(readr)
data <- read_delim("your_file.txt", delim = "|")

# 2. Identifying issues with the provided inline CSV files
# Here we analyze each read_csv command to identify what's wrong:
# Example 1
read_csv("a,b\n1,2,3\n4,5,6")
# Issue: There are more values than column names.
# What happens: This will throw an error because the number of columns is inconsistent with the header.


# Example 2
read_csv("a,b,c\n1,2\n1,2,3,4")
# Issue: The first data row has fewer values than columns, and the second data row has more values than columns.
# What happens: This will throw an error due to inconsistent numbers of columns.

# Example 3
read_csv("a,b\n\"1")
# Issue: The quoted string is not properly closed.
# What happens: This will throw an error due to improper quoting of the string.

# Example 4
read_csv("a,b\n1,2\na,b")
# Issue: The data types are inconsistent; the first row has numeric values and the second has character values.
# What happens: This may result in a parsing issue where the columns are all coerced into character type.

# Example 5
read_csv("a;b\n1;3")
# Issue: The delimiter used in the data is ; instead of ,.
# What happens: This will not read the data correctly because the delimiter does not match the default ,. It will treat the entire line as a single column.


### 3. Handling strings with commas using a quoting character

# To read a CSV file where the strings contain commas and are quoted with a different character, you need to specify the `quote` argument in the `read_csv()` function. For example, if single quotes are used:
library(readr)
data <- read_csv("x,y\n1, 'a,b'", quote = "'")
# This specifies that the single quote character (') is used for quoting strings, allowing the comma within the quoted string to be handled correctly.
